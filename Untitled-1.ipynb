Ronald Vines and his sons tried to rob a bank\\nat gunpoint. He pleaded guilty to both attempted armed bank\\nrobbery and brandishing a gun while committing a crime of\\nviolence. Now he challenges his second conviction, insisting\\nthat attempted armed bank robbery is not a crime of violence\\nbecause someone can attempt an armed bank robbery without\\nusing force, violence, or intimidation.\\n    He is wrong. Even without a weapon, attempted bank rob-\\nbery under 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a)’s first paragraph is a crime of\\nviolence because it requires making the attempt “by force and\\nviolence, or by intimidation.” And adding a gun makes the rob-\\nbery no less violent. § 2113(d). Common sense tells us that, but\\nso does the categorical approach. This is the rare night when\\nthe blue moon has risen. So the District Court rightly upheld\\nVines’s conviction and sentence.\\n       I. VINES TRIED TO ROB A BANK AT GUNPOINT\\n    One morning, Vines and his two adult sons left the house\\non a mission. They got a loaded rifle, a loaded revolver, a face\\nmask, body armor, zip ties, a police scanner, handheld radios,\\nand a tarp and hit the road. The road led to the bank, where they\\nhung up the tarp outside, hid behind it, and watched the bank\\ntellers arrive. While Vines and one of his sons waited behind\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               3\\n\\n\\x0c\\nthe tarp, the other son put on the face mask, grabbed the re-\\nvolver, and snuck up on a teller. He forced her inside at gun-\\npoint but was spotted by another employee who screamed and\\nfled, drawing attention. Vines signaled for his son to flee, so\\nthey hopped back into the car and hit the road again. This time,\\ntheir trip was cut short by police.\\n    Vines pleaded guilty to two federal crimes. The first was\\nattempted armed bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2113(d) &\\n2 (aiding and abetting). That violation was based on attempting\\nto violate § 2113(a), specifically the first clause of the first par-\\nagraph, which criminalizes bank robbery. The second crime\\npiggybacked on the first: brandishing a gun while committing\\na crime of violence (the attempted armed bank robbery), in viola-\\ntion of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) & 2 (aiding and abetting).\\n    Because Vines’s lawyer neither objected to his § 924(c)\\ncharge nor appealed, Vines had to challenge his conviction and\\nsentence collaterally. See 28 U.S.C. § 2255. He claimed that his\\nconviction for attempted armed bank robbery was not a crime\\nof violence under § 924(c). The District Court denied that motion\\nbut granted a certificate of appealability. On appeal, Vines got\\npermission also to argue that his plea lawyer was ineffective\\nfor not asserting that attempted armed bank robbery is not a\\ncrime of violence. Both claims turn on pure legal issues, so we\\nreview them de novo. United States v. Jenkins, 68 F.4th 148,\\n151 (3d Cir. 2023).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 4\\n\\n\\x0c\\n       II. WE APPLY THE CATEGORICAL APPROACH\\n          TO § 2113(d) AND THE ROBBERY CLAUSE\\n           OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF § 2113(a)\\n\\n    To figure out if Vines’s § 2113(d) conviction was a predi-\\ncate crime of violence under § 924(c), we use the much-maligned\\ncategorical approach. United States v. Jordan, 96 F.4th 584,\\n589 (3d Cir. 2024). That approach forbids us to consider what\\nVines actually did. Instead, it forces us to imagine the least vio-\\nlent conduct that a hypothetical defendant might have done to\\nbe convicted of this crime. Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. 184,\\n191 (2013); Mathis v. United States, 579 U.S. 500, 504 (2016).\\nHere, that means concocting the least culpable violation of\\n§ 2113(d) and asking whether it “match[es] the elements of” a\\ncrime of violence as defined in § 924(c)(3)(A). Mathis, 579\\nU.S. at 504.\\n    Before we get to that matching, we must first figure out the\\nelements of § 2113(d). Statutes often are divisible: They “list\\nelements in the alternative, and thereby define multiple\\ncrimes.” Mathis, 579 U.S. at 505. But we can separate out these\\ncrimes and focus on only the elements that were “integral to\\nthe defendant’s conviction.” Id.\\n   We start with Vines’s conviction for attempted armed bank\\nrobbery. Section 2113(d) applies to:\\n   Whoever, in committing, or in attempting to commit,\\n   any offense defined in subsections (a) and (b) of this\\n   section, assaults any person, or puts in jeopardy the life\\n   of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon or de-\\n   vice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                5\\n\\n\\x0c\\n    So a conviction under § 2113(d) can be based on either (a)\\nor (b) and “incorporates each subsection’s elements.” Jordan,\\n96 F.4th at 591. Subsections (a) and (b) apply to different kinds\\nof bank theft: (a) covers robbery, extortion, and burglary, while\\n(b) covers larceny. We have already held that these subsections\\nare divisible from each other. Id. at 590. And Vines pleaded\\nguilty to violating subsection (a), so we can focus just on that\\nsubsection. The subsection has two paragraphs: the first cover-\\ning robbery and extortion; the second, burglary. We have al-\\nready held that the first paragraph is divisible from the second,\\nand Vines pleaded guilty to violating the first. Id. So we can\\nfocus on that paragraph alone.\\n    But now we must dive a level deeper. Subsection (a)’s first\\nparagraph contains two separate clauses: one criminalizes tak-\\ning a bank’s property (or attempting to take it) “by force and\\nviolence, or by intimidation”; the other bars “obtain[ing] or\\nattempt[ing] to obtain” a bank’s property “by extortion.”\\n§ 2113(a). We ask whether these clauses are divisible or must\\nbe analyzed together. We hold that they are divisible.\\n   A person violates the first paragraph of § 2113(a) if he:\\n   by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts\\n   to take, from the person or presence of another, or obtains\\n   or attempts to obtain by extortion any property or money or\\n   any other thing of value belonging to, or in the care, cus-\\n   tody, control, management, or possession of, any bank,\\n   credit union, or any savings and loan association.\\n18 U.S.C. § 2113(a) (first paragraph).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               6\\n\\n\\x0c\\n     Here is that paragraph with each clause split out:\\n     [First clause: bank robbery] by force and violence, or\\n     by intimidation, takes, or attempts to take, from the per-\\n     son or presence of another,\\nor\\n     [Second clause: bank extortion] obtains or attempts to\\n     obtain by extortion [various types of bank property, like\\n     its money].\\nId. (line breaks added).\\n    Almost all our sister circuits that have addressed the ques-\\ntion agree that these two clauses set out two separate, divisible\\ncrimes: bank robbery and bank extortion. King v. United\\nStates, 965 F.3d 60, 69 (1st Cir. 2020); United States v. Evans,\\n924 F.3d 21, 28 (2d Cir. 2019); United States v. Watson, 881\\nF.3d 782, 786 (9th Cir. 2018); United States v. Armstrong, 122\\nF.4th 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 2024). Contra United States v. Bur-\\nwell, 122 F.4th 984, 986 (D.C. Cir. 2024).\\n   That near-consensus is sound. The first clause applies to\\nsomeone who uses force, violence, or intimidation to take\\nsomething: in other words, robbery. 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a); see 4\\nWilliam Blackstone, Commentaries *241–42. And the second\\nclause explicitly requires extortion. Those distinct concepts\\nhave distinct requirements. Robbery traditionally meant taking\\nsomething from someone against her will. See id.; 1 Matthew\\nHale, The History of the Pleas of the Crown *532. By contrast,\\nextortion traditionally meant taking someone else’s property\\nwith the victim’s consent but inducing that consent wrongfully.\\nSee Scheidler v. Nat’l Org. for Women, Inc., 537 U.S. 393, 403\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 7\\n\\n\\x0c\\n(2003); United States v. Harris, 916 F.3d 948, 954–55 (11th\\nCir. 2019). That explains why the first clause requires\\n“tak[ing], or attempt[ing] to take” something, while the second\\nclause requires only “obtain[ing], or attempt[ing] to obtain” it.\\n§ 2113(a).\\n    Now turn back to the crime that Vines was charged with. A\\nconviction for attempted armed bank robbery under § 2113(d)\\nrequires proof of both (1) the elements of attempted bank rob-\\nbery under § 2113(a)’s paragraph one, clause one, and (2) the\\nelements of attempted armed bank robbery under § 2113(d). If\\neither provision requires force or threatened force, then Vines’s\\nconviction was for a crime of violence and satisfies § 924(c).\\nUnited States v. Wilson, 880 F.3d 80, 83 (3d Cir. 2018); Jordan,\\n96 F.4th at 594. As we will explain, both are crimes of violence.\\n    That is where we part ways with the dissent. Although our\\ndissenting colleague would find that § 2113(a) controls the def-\\ninition of completed armed bank robbery, the dissent would by-\\npass § 2113(a) when defining attempts. The dissent would in-\\nstead find that there is a separate standalone crime of attempted\\narmed bank robbery under § 2113(d) where the meaning of at-\\ntempt is given content by the common law, rather than\\n§ 2113(a). But the dissent does not explain why we would ap-\\nply § 2113(a) only in part (that is, only to completed crimes)\\nwhen analyzing crimes set forth in § 2113(d). There is no such\\nthing as a freestanding conviction for attempted bank robbery\\nunder § 2113(d); it must also satisfy the elements of § 2113(a)\\nthat we already have held are “incorporate[d]” into it. Id. at\\n591. If a conviction under § 2113(d) must incorporate elements\\nthat make it a crime of violence, it defies common sense not to\\ncall it one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               8\\n\\n\\x0c\\n         III. ATTEMPTED ARMED BANK ROBBERY\\n                 IS A CRIME OF VIOLENCE\\n   A. Attempted bank robbery under § 2113(a) is a crime\\n      of violence\\n    1. Attempted bank robbery requires force, violence, or\\nintimidation. Like almost all our sister circuits, we have held\\nthat completed bank robbery under § 2113(a) is a crime of vio-\\nlence. Wilson, 880 F.3d at 88. But see Burwell, 122 F.4th at\\n987. But we have never addressed whether attempted bank rob-\\nbery is, and our sister circuits are divided. Compare Collier v.\\nUnited States, 989 F.3d 212, 221 (2d Cir. 2021) (holding that\\nattempted bank robbery requires force or intimidation), United\\nStates v. Bellew, 369 F.3d 450, 454 (5th Cir. 2004) (same), and\\nUnited States v. Thornton, 539 F.3d 741, 747 (7th Cir. 2008)\\n(same), with United States v. McFadden, 739 F.2d 149, 151–\\n52 (4th Cir. 1984) (holding that attempted bank robbery does\\nnot require force or intimidation), United States v. Wesley, 417\\nF.3d 612, 618 (6th Cir. 2005) (same), and United States v.\\nMoore, 921 F.2d 207, 209 (9th Cir. 1990) (same).\\n    This disagreement stems from a seeming ambiguity in\\n§ 2113(a). Recall that the first clause of the first paragraph\\napplies to:\\n   Whoever, by force and violence, or by intimidation,\\n   takes, or attempts to take, from the person or presence\\n   of another [property of a bank].\\n18 U.S.C. § 2113(a).\\n   All courts agree that the verb “takes” is qualified by the\\nadverbial phrase “by force and violence, or by intimidation”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               9\\n\\n\\x0c\\nthat comes right before it. The supposed ambiguity is whether\\nthat same adverbial phrase also modifies “attempts to take.” If\\nit does, then the attempt must be carried out “by force and vio-\\nlence, or by intimidation.” We hold that this adverbial phrase\\ndoes modify both verbs. So even for an attempt, the govern-\\nment must prove force, violence, or intimidation.\\n   On close inspection, the ambiguity evaporates. We start and\\nend with the text, proceeding left to right. Section 2113(a)\\nkicks off with a subject immediately followed by an adverbial\\nphrase:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    The adverbial phrase comprises two parts. First comes “by\\nforce and violence,” followed with “or by intimidation.” The\\nlatter is offset by commas. It is not the most elegant wordsmith-\\ning, to be sure, but it gets the point across: Whatever follows\\nwill be modified by the adverbial phrase. Sure enough, right\\nafter the second comma comes the first item of a short list: a\\nmain verb (“takes”). The preceding adverbial phrase qualifies\\nhow the actor must do that taking: “by force or violence, or\\nby intimidation.” So far, so good.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               10\\n\\n\\x0c\\nattempted robbery under § 2113(a), I would concur with the\\nmajority that he was guilty of a crime of violence under 18\\nU.S.C. 924(c). But Ronald Vines was convicted under 18\\nU.S.C. § 2113(d). And for all the persuasiveness of the\\nmajority’s textual analysis, none of it focuses on the provision\\nthat is actually in front of us.\\n       That matters. Unlike its counterpart, § 2113(d)’s\\nattempt provision does not contain any language even arguably\\nsuggesting the defendant must commit the underlying attempt\\nforcibly. Instead, it merely requires an offender to “attempt[]\\nto commit, any offense defined in subsections (a) and (b).”3\\n       In grafting § 2113(a)’s forcible attempt standard onto §\\n\\n\\nfalls between an unanalyzed issue and an overlooked argument\\nwill often (I suspect usually) be unclear. And, given the\\nprofound implications for our judicial system, further en banc\\nguidance in this area is sorely needed. But, pending such\\nguidance, I am persuaded that Garner’s cursory and under-\\nbriefed discussion of § 2113(a) (which had no bearing on the\\nissues which prompted us to label that decision precedential)\\nfalls within the Grant exception. I caution, however, that\\nwhatever latitude this Court affords itself in departing from\\nI.O.P. 9.1 (which, at bottom, is a doctrine of court\\nadministration) should not be read reflexively to authorize the\\nsame latitude for district courts (whose constitutional duty to\\nobey our rulings does not hinge on their confidence in our\\nissue-spotting). See Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wullschleger,\\n604 U.S. 22, 43 n.10 (2025).\\n3\\n  18 U.S.C. § 2113(d). That Congress may have wished to\\npermit conviction under § 2113(d) for attempts that did not\\nprogress far enough to violate § 2113(a) is unsurprising, given\\nthe increased risk to the public posed by § 2113(d) violations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               3\\n\\n\\x0c\\n2113(d), the majority implicitly rewrites the text of § 2113(d)\\nso that, rather than read “whoever, in committing or attempting\\nto commit, any offense,” it reads “whoever, in committing any\\noffense or in committing the attempt provision of any\\noffense.” That contortion, which has no basis in the statute, is\\nno less textually questionable than the inside-out sandwiches\\nthe majority decries.\\n       The majority’s approach is also demonstratively\\nuntenable in the context of § 2113(d).4 By its express terms,\\nan attempted violation of § 2113(d) can be predicated on\\nviolating either § 2113(a) (bank robbery) or § 2113(b) (bank\\nlarceny), and at least one of our sister circuits has upheld §\\n2113(d) charges based solely on an attempted violation of §\\n2113(b).5 This is true even though § 2113(b) does not contain\\nan attempt provision, and it is well-recognized that a defendant\\ncannot be prosecuted for attempting to violate § 2113(b)\\nalone.6 Yet the single instance of the word “attempting” in §\\n2113(d) can obviously only have one meaning.7 It follows\\n\\n4\\n  United States v.

Hsu, 155\\nF.3d 189, 202 (3d Cir. 1998)).\\n10\\n   See United States v.

While §\\n2113(d)’s aggravating factors certainly entail the “use,\\nthreatened use, or attempted use of force,” they do not require\\nthat force to be exerted against a third party, do not require that\\nforce to be knowing, and, accordingly, do not provide an\\nindependent basis for deeming § 2113(d) a crime of violence.\\n                               A.\\n\\n        As the majority acknowledges, a crime whose force\\nelement could theoretically be self-directed is not a crime of\\nviolence for the purpose of § 924.12 Yet, as the majority\\nrecognizes, § 2113(d) can be facially violated by a defendant\\nwho “assaults any person, or puts in jeopardy the life of any\\nperson.”13 And while it is questionable if someone can assault\\nhimself, it is certainly possible for a defendant to put his own\\nlife in jeopardy while trying to rob a bank. Consider a robber\\nwho holds a gun to his own head and threatens self-harm unless\\na teller (or potential co-conspirator) cooperates, or one who\\nstarts driving to the robbery site with a loaded weapon he does\\nnot subjectively intend to use.14 Or consider a robber who\\n\\n11\\n   18 U.S.C. § 2113(d).\\n12\\n   See United States v.

But it misapplies that\\nprecedent. In Jordan, we noted that to commit completed bank\\nrobbery under § 2113(a) a defendant must use force against\\n“another.”16 We further noted that aggravated bank robbery\\nunder § 2113(d) requires a defendant to both (1) commit\\ncompleted generic robbery under § 2113(a) and (2) satisfy an\\naggravating factor.17 We therefore held that, regardless of\\nwhether § 2113(d)’s aggravating factor required force, the\\ncrime as a whole was a crime of violence. But in committing\\ncompleted robbery under subsection (a) the defendant had\\n\\n15\\n   See McLaughlin v.

As discussed\\nabove, the first element does not qualify as using, threatening\\nto use, or attempting to use force at all.18 We know that from\\nTaylor. And because the aggravating factor itself does not\\nrequire the use of force against another, it follows that neither\\nprong of attempted robbery under § 2113(d) necessarily\\nsatisfies § 924(c).\\n                               B.\\n\\n      It is well-settled that, to qualify as a crime of violence\\nunder 924(c), an offense must involve the purposeful or\\nknowing (not just reckless) use of force.19 In addition to not\\nnecessarily involving the use of force against another, the\\nsecond prong of § 2113(d) further fails to meet § 924(c)’s force\\n\\n18\\n   While I reach this conclusion because the attempt prong in §\\n2113(d) does not incorporate by reference the “by force and\\nviolence, or by intimidation” clause in § 2113(a), I note that\\nthe same would hold if the attempt prong of § 2113(a) were\\nitself not a crime of violence—as the majority assumes\\narguendo in its discussion of § 2113(d).\\n19\\n   See Borden v.

It is true that the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\\nCircuit appears to have held that § 2113(d) requires the\\nknowing use of force. See United States v. Buck, 23 F.4th 919,\\n929 (9th Cir. 2022) (asserting without analysis that “§ 2113(d)\\nrequires that the robber knowingly made one or more victims\\nat the scene of the robbery aware that he had a gun” (cleaned\\nup)). But Buck based this assertion on United States v. Henry,\\n984 F.3d 1343, 1358 (9th Cir. 2021), which in turn cited United\\nStates v. McDuffy, 890 F.3d 796, 799 (9th Cir. 2018), which in\\nturn relied on United States v. Odom, 329 F.3d 1032, 1035 (9th\\nCir. 2003), which based itself on the Supreme Court’s\\nconclusion in Bailey v. United States that “using” a firearm\\nunder a parallel statute required “active employment.” 516\\nU.S. 137, 143 (1995). The Supreme Court has since clarified\\nthat, as used in Bailey, this phrase included reckless (as well as\\nknowing) conduct. Voisine, 579 U.S. at 695–96.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                9\\n\\n\\x0c\\nwhere an attempted armed bank robber could place others’\\nlives at risk recklessly, such as by accidentally discharging a\\nfirearm,21 or crashing a car while speeding to the robbery site.22\\nAll such scenarios would be covered by § 2113(d), but they\\nwould lack the requisite mens rea for a crime of violence.23\\nAnd because any mismatch is enough to render a crime non-\\nviolent, it follows that § 2113(d) is categorically not a crime of\\nviolence under § 924(c).\\n                               ***\\n\\n\\n21\\n    See Dean v. U.S., 556 U.S. 558, 576 (2009) (noting that an\\n“individual who brings a loaded weapon to commit a crime\\nruns the risk that the gun will discharge accidentally”); United\\nStates v. Jackson, 534 Fed.App’x. 917, 920 (11th Cir. 2013)\\n(noting that “an accidental discharge of a firearm is a\\nreasonably foreseeable result of bringing a gun to an attempted\\nbank robbery”).\\n22\\n    See Mills, 1 F.3d at 420–21 (treating a speeding car as a\\n“dangerous device”). That the defendant may have intended to\\ncommit the § 2113(a) predicate offense is irrelevant. Borden\\ndoes not just require that a defendant commit some knowing\\ncrime and, simultaneously, commit a crime involving force—\\nit requires the force itself (or threatened or attempted force) be\\nused knowingly. See 593 U.S. at 432 (holding that a defendant\\nwho “has not used force ‘against’ another person in the targeted\\nway that clause requires” has not committed a crime of\\nviolence).\\n23\\n   In Jordan, we noted that a completed violation of § 2113(a)\\nrequires the knowing use of force, and therefore concluded that\\na completed violation of § 2113(d) does as well. 96 F.4th at\\n594. As already discussed, supra n.18, that syllogism has no\\nrelevance when it comes to attempted violations of § 2113(d).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               10\\n\\n\\x0c\\n        The categorical approach has as many critics as there\\nare judges. The conclusions it yields are often counterintuitive,\\ncounter-logical, and contrary to what Congress likely intended.\\nBut it is the law, and fairly applying it compels the conclusion\\nthat 18 U.S.C. § 2113(d) is not a crime of violence. Because\\nthe majority concludes otherwise, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               11'"
