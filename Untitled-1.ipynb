WASTE SYSTEM AUTHORITY OF EASTERN MONTGOMERY COUNTY Nos. 00-2936 & 00-2949 UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT Argued July 27, 2001 Filed November 7, 2001 On Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania District Court Judge: Ronald L.

Benjamin E. Zuckerman (argued), Cozen and O\\'Connor, The Atrium, 1900 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, for Appellee. Before: Roth, Barry, and Fuentes, Circuit Judges OPINION OF THE COURT Fuentes, Circuit Judge. 1 This is an appeal from orders of the District Court dismissing, for lack of standing, Count One from each of plaintiffs\\' separate complaints. 1 Plaintiffs (collectively referred to as \"the Building Owners\") are owners of apartment houses and office buildings in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. They brought their actions under 42 U.S.C. S 1983 against defendant, the Waste System Authority of Eastern Montgomery County (\"Waste Authority\"), asserting violations of their rights under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, S 8, cl. 3. Specifically, the Building Owners challenge the Waste Authority\\'s implementation of a waste generation fee (\"WGF \") structure, which has the purpose of funding a local waste processing plant. The Building Owners maintain that the Waste Authority\\'s fee structure effectively forces them to use the local facility to the exclusion of more affordable out-of-state options, in contravention of the Commerce Clause. Because we hold that the Building Owners have standing to litigate this claim, we will reverse and remand the cases for further proceedings. I. 2 Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, first forayed into waste management by developing a municipal plan for solid waste disposal that divides the county into three solid waste districts, one of which is the Eastern District. Approximately two dozen municipalities of the eastern portion of the county constitute the Eastern District. In 1989, Montgomery County established the Waste Authority to serve as the municipal authority in the Eastern District. 3 In implementing its waste management plan, Montgomery County contracted with a private company, the Montenay Montgomery Limited Partnership (\"Montenay\"), to construct and operate a waste-to-steam plant. In May 1989, Montgomery County\\'s industrial development authority issued $107 million in revenue bonds to finance the construction of a waste-to-steam plant that Montenay would purchase, build, and operate (\"the Montenay Facility\"). 4 In order to ensure that the Montenay Facility generated sufficient revenue to cover its operations and to repay the bonds, Montgomery County, the Waste Authority, and the municipalities in the Eastern District enacted flow control ordinances. The ordinances required that all solid waste produced in the Eastern District be processed at the Montenay Facility. In addition, the Waste Authority imposed on trash haulers a \"tipping fee\" to be assessed each time the haulers deposited trash for processing at the Montenay Facility. The tipping fee was set at a level sufficient to cover the expenses and liabilities of managing the Montenay Facility, as well as to enable Montenay to repay the bonds. As a result of the ordinances and the tipping fees, trash haulers were obligated to bring all Eastern District waste to transfer stations for later processing at the Montenay Facility and to pay an above market tipping fee for the waste processing service. 5 In 1994, the United States Supreme Court decided the case of C&A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, New York, 511 U.S. 383 (1994), placing the Eastern District flow control scheme in jeopardy. The Court ruled that flow control systems, such as the one implemented by Montgomery County, violate the Commerce Clause. Montgomery County responded to C&A Carbone by forming a Blue Ribbon Panel in 1997 to devise a new method of ensuring Montenay an adequate revenue stream to operate the waste disposal facility and to repay its debt obligations. 6 In early 1998, the Blue Ribbon Panel recommended that the Waste Authority use its governmental power to create a waste generating fee structure. On January 1, 1999, the Waste Authority adopted the panel\\'s recommendation. This new WGF structure differs from the previous flow control system in that it transfers the burden of generating revenue for the Montenay facility from trash haulers to waste generators. Haulers of trash that originated within the Eastern District are no longer charged a tipping fee. Instead, these haulers are allowed to dump free of charge, ... dormant Commerce Clause challenge where it paid the tax and the tax scheme affected its contract with an out-of-state gas provider); West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U.S. 186 (1994) (in-state milk producer waged a successful dormant Commerce Clause challenge where it was subject to a discriminatory tax and was a party to the transactions which were burdened). Although standing was not directly addressed in Camps and West Lynn, in all of these cases the in-state companies were within the \"zone of interests\" of the dormant Commerce Clause because they \"sought to protect their own rights to purchase goods or do business across state borders, without being subject to a discriminatory tax.\" Ben Oehrleins and Sons and Daughter, Inc. v. Hennepin County, 115 F.3d 1372, 1381 (8th Cir. 1997). 34 Waste disposal cases from courts of appeals which have considered the issue have explicitly or implicitly come to the same conclusion. See On the Green Apartments L.L.C. v. City of Tacoma, 241 F.3d 1235 (9th Cir. 2001); Huish Detergents, Inc. v. Warren County, Kentucky, 214 F.3d 707 (6th Cir. 2000); Individuals for Responsible Gov\\'t, Inc. v. Washoe County, 110 F.3d 699 (9th Cir. 1997); Ben Oehrleins, supra. In these cases, albeit for different reasons, the courts recognized a waste generator\\'s standing to bring a dormant Commerce Clause claim where the waste generator alleged that its ability to contract directly with the hauler or processor of its choice was infringed by local regulation. On the Green and Huish Detergents, on which the majority relies, are two such cases. Where, however, the waste generator did not allege that its ability to contract directly with its hauler or processor of choice was infringed and instead asserted only that its injury was higher cost in-state services or some injury derivative of its hauler\\'s injury, the waste generators were found to lack standing. Washoe County, supra; Ben Oehrleins, supra. Indeed, the On the Green Court relied on Washoe County when it found that the waste generator lacked standing with regard to its second claim, i.e. a claim of financial injury merely because it was forced to pay for unwanted services. Although the courts did not always articulate the importance of direct involvement in the relevant interstate commerce decision and injury related to the dormant Commerce Clause, those considerations clearly run through each of these cases. 35 In Huish, for example, the Sixth Circuit held that the waste generator who was subject to a local regulation which required it to send all of its waste to a designated facility had standing because it sought \"to protect its right to contract with a company that can transport its waste for out-of-state processing and/or disposal.\" Huish, 214 F.3d at 710-711 (emphasis added). The Huish Court also held that the waste generator\\'s direct participation in the sought after out-of-state transaction distinguished Huish from the Sixth Circuit\\'s decision in Ben Oehrleins. Id. at 711 . In On the Green, standing was found as to a waste generator who was a self-hauler who alleged that it could not contract freely with out-of-state processors but, rather, was required to haul only to a city landfill. In contrast, in Washoe County and Ben Oehrleins -- and in the payment for unwanted services claim in On the Green -- the waste generators who lacked standing did not allege any direct participation in the subject interstate commerce decision and alleged only that they were subject to higher fees because of a local ordinance. While I do not contend that this is the only difference in these cases, it is a difference, I believe, of utmost importance to the standing question. 36 The Building Owners fall into the latter category. For starters, they do not allege that their ability to contract directly with the hauler of their choice -- even an out-of-state hauler -- is at issue in this case and, unlike the waste generators in Huish and On the Green, they are not, as the majority suggests, compelled to patronize the local market. Rather, the transaction at issue here is the processing decision -- where the waste ends up. The Building Owners claim that the haulers with whom they contract are put in an untenable position when they, the haulers, decide where to tip the waste -- \"untenable\" (although that hardly seems the right word) because they tip for free and thus it is \"obvious\" they will tip at the Montenay facility. The Building Owners do not allege any involvement in the decision making process to determine where their waste is tipped, nor do they allege that they seek to become self-haulers and make this decision for themselves. Accordingly, even accepting the Building Owners\\' allegations as true, I conclude that any injury they suffer is derivative of their haulers\\' injury and they are one step removed from the interstate transaction or decision which is allegedly burdened. Their interests, therefore, are too marginally related to the purpose behind the dormant Commerce Clause for them to have standing. 37 Nor am I convinced, as the majority seems to be, that the Waste Generation Fee itself confers standing on the Building Owners. If this case were akin to Camps or General Motors, in which a party involved in the interstate decision was assessed a discriminatory tax, I would not be writing this dissent. Here, however, the Building Owners are merely consumers of hauling services who are subject to a flat fee for services they may not or do not want. Without even an allegation that they are also parties to the transaction or decision they claim is burdened or that their ability to contract directly with an out-of-state company is adversely affected, the injury of which the Building Owners complain is simply not within the zone of interests the Commerce Clause was intended to protect. I would affirm. NOTE: 1 In this connection, the argument that the haulers here -- who tip without payment of any fee -- are \"burdened\" at all is somewhat hard to understand.'"
